Huffman Decode with Shannon Entropy
===================================
Huffman's decode algorithm with Shannon Entropy calculator.

Accepts a file "decodeFIXED.txt" with the scheme the first N lines and the actual encrypted code on the last line.

Calculates Shannon Entropy (minimum number of bits that could have been used to encrypt the same message).
